# GenerativeModels
DCGAN is based on GAN, which composed of two models in neural networks:

- The first model is called a **Generator** and it aims to generate new data similar to the real one. In DCGAN it would generate an unexisted image that we call fake image for this project. 

- The second model is named the **Discriminator** and it aims to recognize if a data is ‘real’ — belongs to the original dataset; Or if it is ‘fake’ — generated by a forger. Whose output is a binary 1 or 0.
