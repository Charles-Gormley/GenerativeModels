    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a framework to train generative models, such as deep convolutional neural networks for generating images. GAN composed of two models which are trained simultaneously by an adversarial process. A generator model (\"the artist\") learns to create fake images that look real, while a discriminator model (\"the art critic\") learns to tell real images apart from fakes. \n",

The generator of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) are mainly composes of convolution layers without max pooling with convolutional stride and transposed convolution (Fractionally-strided convolution or Deconvolution) for the downsampling and the upsampling of 2D images.  \n",
